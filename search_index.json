Considering we have lots of new players coming with KAG F2P release we decided to write this new player friendly guide. We hope it’ll help people who try to get better at knight. We’re going to cover everything: improving your skills on various levels, how to play on CTF, how to deal with high ping or bugs, and every knight trick/move you can do in this game and much more. It may seem like a lot, but knight combat is very extensive and if you really want to get better this guide will certainly help you. For just a collection of knight tips and tricks see the Knight Compendium. For a tutorial on playing as builder see Builder Guides. Also you can contact us on KAG Discord (bunnie#8671, deynarde#4491). Thanks to Turtlebutt and Homek for help with recording gifs. "],
["knight-i-the-basics.html", "Chapter 1 Knight I: The basics 1.1 The knight class 1.2 Mechanics 1.3 Items 1.4 Mobility 1.5 Getting good", " Chapter 1 Knight I: The basics 1.1 The knight class There are 3 main classes in KAG: the archer, the builder and the knight. The knight is arguably the strongest class of the game. A good team in Capture The Flag or Take The Halls should be mostly composed of knights protecting builders and archers. In Team Deathmatch the knight is the most often played class as well. As a knight in CTF and TTH, your role is to help the team advance forward to capture the enemy flag or hall. Before you learn more about game modes and how to play in a team, let’s talk about the combat mechanics first. 1.2 Mechanics As a knight, you can use your sword and shield to do the following stuff: 1.2.1 Jab The simplest attack. It does 1 heart of damage. 1.2.2 Slash Charged attack (it takes half a second to charge it – just watch the cursor), it does 2 hearts of damage and stuns the enemy for a short time. If the enemy is shielding, it stuns for a bit less time, and the enemy doesn’t get damaged. Being able to do slashes as fast as possible is very important – you should be able to do them as soon as the cursor charges fully. 1.2.3 Double slash Charged double attack (it takes 1 and 1/4 of a second to charge it, again, watch the cursor), does 4 hearts in total (if unshielded). If the enemy is shielding, the first slash pierces the shield, the second slash deals 2 hearts of damage. For now you should keep in mind that if you jab a shield, you get stunned for a short while. Try avoiding doing that, because you can get jabbed during that moment, or in some cases even slashed: 1.2.4 Shield slide Hold W and shield down while moving horizontally to slide. 1.2.5 Shield bash Also known as a shield stun. If you quickly shield slide into someone, they can get stunned for a short time (and sometimes knocked back): 1.2.6 Shield glide Use the shield as a parachute: 1.2.7 Stomping Not really a knight-only move, but you can also stomp the enemy if you fall on him with enough momentum. Of course, you can do much more with these moves – you can chain combos, slashing someone and then quickly jabbing them after, but you’ll learn about that later on. For now, it’s just important to know the theory on how the combat works. The one thing you should remember is to mostly use slashes for now – the most common mistake a newbie can do is to jab spam, which is easily counterable and can quickly get you killed. 1.3 Items There are various knight-specific items, such as bombs and waterbombs, which can be bought at the knight workshop in CTF (25 coins for a bomb, 30 coins for a waterbomb), trader shop in TDM (20 coins for a bomb, 40 coins for a waterbomb) or generated by factories in TTH. 1.3.1 Bombs Bombs can be activated with space bar button. It takes 4 seconds before a bomb explodes. You can throw bombs near enemies to damage them (the damage depends on how close the bomb was – 3 hearts or 1,5 hearts), or use it to do a bomb jump. Keep in mind that if you throw the bomb too early the enemies can catch it and throw it back. 1.3.2 Waterbombs Waterbombs explode on impact and stun for a short duration. If shielded, they stun for a slightly shorter time. You can also put a sponge in your inventory (bought at TDM trader shop or CTF builder shop) which will also reduce the stun duration. If you successfully stun someone with it, you could for example kill him with a double slash. In the above video the stunned person had a sponge in the inventory. 1.3.3 Mines Mines can be bought for 60 coins in a knight shop and can be activated by all classes. Mines activate after staying still on the ground for some time. Mines instakill enemies and can’t be shielded, so you should watch out for enemy mines! This is especially important when playing CTF and pushing with your team in a closed space – let the builders destroy the mines, don’t walk into them – if you walk into a mine and your teammates are also near, they will be killed as well 1.3.4 Kegs Keg (costs 120 coins in knight shop) is a powerful and unshieldable explosive item with a 6 seconds fuse. You should avoid fighting enemies while holding a keg (you can’t put it in your inventory) because they may steal it and hurt your team (one of the most common mistakes that can be made). Generally, you should activate kegs in the middle of the enemy base or next to the enemy flag room. 1.4 Mobility One of the most important things to learn when you’re starting to play KAG is how to navigate the terrain properly: if you don’t feel your character and its movement, you will have trouble slashing your enemies from a distance or even avoiding enemy attacks. You have to be able to move around obstacles freely, consistently use wall jumps, use your slash to gain additional momentum or jump forward while slashing to quickly move through terrain. There’s not really much to explain here – it just takes a bit of practice. If you want to get better with movement faster, you can try experimenting with it on the solo gamemodes (Save the Princess, Challenges modes). You will learn more about mobility tricks at the start of the next chapter. 1.5 Getting good Every time you die to someone, ask yourself the question – why did I die? Could I’ve done something to avoid death? Did I mess up timing or get baited by the enemy? Try to learn on your mistakes and minimize them as much as possible - look at what you’re doing wrong (jabbing enemy’s shield, bad slash timing and so on) and try optimizing your playstyle. Remember to slash often – if you constantly slash, the enemies will be afraid to get closer to you. Make use of double slashes as well – the first slash pierces through the shield and the second one deals 2 hearts of damage, as mentioned earlier. Don’t get demotivated if you’re not as good as you want to be – as we said earlier, at this level you just need to practice a lot and skill will come with time. Most of the players get stuck at what this guide considers the average level. The next chapters should help you getting past that point. "],
["knight-ii-intermediate.html", "Chapter 2 Knight II: Intermediate 2.1 Knight model, slash and jab range 2.2 On learning itself 2.3 More on mobility 2.4 More on combat and using your sword 2.5 The art of shield bashing 2.6 Playing CTF", " Chapter 2 Knight II: Intermediate 2.1 Knight model, slash and jab range We’ll start this section with a word about hitboxes in KAG: The game models a knight as an octagon. Both jab and slash are shaped as arcs, which move with your character and are active for a certain duration (slash lasts much longer than jab). Your shield covers an arc around your character centered on the direction your mouse is pointing. If you think that you were hit through your shield by someone – ask yourself, were you pointing in the right direction to cover the full arc of the attack? It is possible to see the hit boxes for yourself by going into solo sandbox mode, opening the console (by pressing Home key) and typing /g_debug 1. 2.2 On learning itself If you want to get better at knight quickly, playing lots of TDM is a good choice here, but in our opinion the best way to train knight is to play lots of 1v1 – sometimes with people at your skill level, and sometimes with people slightly better than you. 1v1s are the best for this because they allow you to fully focus on the knight combat, while in TDM you have to watch out for archers (and water bombs, which aren’t used in 1v1s) and in CTF – you should care about winning the game, not KDR. You should always try to be as consistent as possible. For a lot of moves, you just need to get into the habit of using them. If you really want to get better, we recommend always focusing and actually trying, no matter what enemies you are playing against or what mode it is; constantly playing optimally helps you train your muscle memory and helps getting used to the mechanics of knight combat in KAG. This applies no matter how good at knight you are – you should always give your best, constantly becoming better this way. As mentioned in the first chapter, analyzing your play style and mistakes also helps a lot. Of course, it’s hard to do it in real-time, so some knights decide to record their gameplay (mainly of 1v1) and analyze the videos later. Summary – don’t stop trying, always give your best, and try to use the moves and tricks you learned here in actual matches, don’t be afraid to experiment with your play style. 2.3 More on mobility At this point, it’s good to learn basic mobility tricks, such as these (taken from the Knight Compendium mentioned earlier) – they’re useful more often than you may think, so you should be able to do them consistently. Good mobility is as important as good timing and reflex. 2.3.1 Slash jumping A knight can jump higher than normal by slashing to give themselves some extra velocity. Time your slash so that it triggers just after you start your jump. It can be combined with upwards shield gliding in order to get extra height. Also, by pushing off the wall as you near the top and then floating back onto it you can climb an extra block – you can climb up to 8 blocks. It’s useful e.g. when you’re escaping from the enemies’ base with their flag. You can also do the same with a double slash – up to 10 blocks can be climbed this way. 2.3.2 Faster movement during slash charging Aiming in the same direction to which you are moving will allow you to go a little faster when charging an attack. You should pretty much always do this! 2.3.3 Quick shield slide Shield sliding is done by pointing the mouse below your character and shielding. But you can move significantly faster by rapidly tapping the W key as you are sliding. For maximum speed, try and hit W as soon as you hit the ground on each bounce. Very useful when you’re escaping from several enemies, or escaping from an enemy charging a double slash. 2.3.4 Climbing arrows It is possible to climb arrows that archers shoot into a tower. It is also possible to navigate around platforms on towers if there are enough arrows. 2.3.5 Using walls for extra velocity Pushing off a wall gives you a small burst of speed. This speed boost can be extremely useful to help you win a slash timing. Good to use against people playing defensively as well. 2.3.6 Following a retreating enemy through doors As an enemy player runs through team doors, they are momentarily left open. This gives you enough time to follow them through. You can often get to enemy shops or flags this way in a CTF game. 2.3.7 Water buoyancy As you wall-climb while underwater you receive a significant speed boost. This can be very useful for surprising your enemy with an upwards slash. 2.3.8 Small shield glide A shield slide can be performed even on a 1 block wide tower. This can be very helpful in CTF to get some extra speed for crossing gaps. 2.3.9 Slash escape Slashing can sometimes be used as an escape mechanism due to the small speed boost it gives. [new giffo ura] 2.3.10 Tower wall jump This is a good way to get some extra horizontal distance when jumping off a tower. To do it, slightly drop off the tower and push off while shield gliding. 2.3.11 Bounce off water Shield sliding onto water will allow you to do a little bounce before you sink. This can be useful for quickly moving over water. 2.3.12 Bomb jumps Mentioned in Knight I: The basics, this is when knights use bombs to send themselves flying across the map. The simplest bomb jump is a single bomb jump. Light your bomb, drop it on the ground and right as it is about to explode jump into the air and shield. Timing is crucial here, and if you time it so you jump and shield at the last possible moment you will go much further (perhaps almost twice as far). You can also do bomb jumps while midair: They’re good for getting around obstacles in CTF, so you should definitely use them often there. You can also do multi bomb jumps – read more about them in Playing CTF section. If you feel like your mobility is already decent enough, you can move to the next part – learning more about combat itself and how to slay enemies properly. But before that, we’ll talk about the best way to learn and how to optimize your play style. 2.4 More on combat and using your sword Most three important things at this level are: 2.4.1 Slashing fast As mentioned in chapter 1, this is very important. You should be able to do slashes as soon as it’s possible (after half a second – watch your cursor). The same applies to double slashes (38 ticks, that is 1 and 1/4 of a second). 2.4.2 Jab after successful slashes This may be obvious, but actually I see this very rarely used, especially on CTF. Basically, you can jab right after successfully slashing someone – the slashed person is stunned for a short while (2/3 of a second), which allows you to land an additional jab in that time (thus dealing in total 3 hearts of damage). You should almost always do this (the exception is when you’re fighting several enemies at once – to prevent accidentally jabbing someone’s shield, you should generally just spam slashes). 2.4.3 Low jumps while slashing This is another very important mechanic that you should get into the habit of doing. You should almost always slightly jump while slashing – you gain additional horizontal momentum, thus cover a bigger distance, and make your sword’s slash range bigger (slash range depends on your momentum). Keep in mind that you should only jump SLIGHTLY. This is a very common mistake people make - jumping too high while slashing makes your slash range worse than if you would actually not jump at all (slashing below you when you’re going up has a very small range), and makes it easier for enemies to slash you from below. There are some more things you should keep in mind, such as: 2.4.4 Using double slashes Another common mistake is just constantly single slashing a shielding enemy. Some people use double slashes too rarely, while they’re also a very good counter against defensive play style, and you can always land a jab after doing one successfully: Of course, this can also be countered by good players, but you’ll learn more about it in the next chapter. This is also very good to use after doing a successful slash+jab combo. Basically, once you do your slash, your enemy is likely to put his shield up and start retreating. You can follow him and double slash for an easy finish. Keep in mind it may not work against better players – they can just jab. 2.4.5 Attacking an enemy stunned by jabbing your shield If your enemy makes a mistake and jabs your shield, you should pretty much always damage him somehow, and get into the habit of doing it. There are 3 ways of doing this. If someone jabs a shield, he’s stunned for 2/3 of a second - that’s plenty of time. Slashing – This option is the best and should be done the most often. As soon as you notice the person get stunned by jabbing your shield, start charging a quick slash. If you’re fast enough, you should always be able to land a 2 heart slash on the enemy (of course, follow it up with a jab if you slashed successfully) Jabbing – If you don’t have the reflexes to do slashes yet, and feel like sometimes you’d start charging the slash too slowly, you can just do a single jab. Keep in mind the earlier option is way superior to this one. Double jabbing – You can actually land two jabs on an enemy stunned by shield jabbing. Just start rapidly clicking as soon as you notice the enemy get stunned. However, keep in mind this is much harder to do than just a slash, and also deals less damage (2 jabs instead of successful slash + jab). Probably requires good ping as well. Using a double slash is pretty much pointless here (the enemy has time to start shielding, so you deal the same damage as you would by doing a single slash, and the enemy may jab you) 2.4.6 Counter slashing If you are against an aggressive player then a way to beat them is to bait them to come forward with their slash or double slash. As they do so, you move back whilst charging your own slash. As their slash ends, you turn and hit them. You can do the same with double slashes. It’s important as well – it’s really hard to counter a defensive play style which focuses on counter slashes. Not impossible, but really hard. Also, this is the best way to fight when you’re fighting against several enemies at once - slash, retreat, slash again, and so on. [gif 29 - fighting against several enemies] 2.4.7 Winning slash fights on L shape In L shape situation, the knight who moves first (red in the image below) tends to lose slash – even if they slashed earlier. This is because they have a large vertical speed but almost no horizontal speed. The knight who moves second (blue) will have a large horizontal speed towards the enemy – and is thus far more likely to win. This situation often occurs in CTF when there are doors on top of towers. It is worth mentioning that the L-shape situation usually favours the knight coming up from below. This is partly because you can move upwards more quickly than you can move sidewards. Also most of the knight’s body is shielded by the blocks going up the wall. In this GIF the blue and red knight arrive at the intersection at roughly the same time, but the blue knight wins. This is usually the case. [gif 31] 2.5 The art of shield bashing As mentioned earlier, you can quickly shield slide horizontally into someone or shield down while jumping at an enemy to stun him for a short while – about half a second. This move is most useful in narrow corridors where it cannot be countered by overhead jab or overhead slash. This is good for interrupting enemy slashes, but the beauty of shield bashes comes from being able to jab someone right after shield bashing him. This is another very important aspect of knight combat – being able to shield bash properly and follow up with jabs can make a big difference, especially when fighting against defensive players. There, of course, are several ways to counter shield bashes, which you should also learn – overhead slashes, overhead jabs and crouches (which you’ll learn more about in the next chapter) Jump over the shield sliding enemy whilst charging a slash and then hit them in the back. In some of the situations, he won’t be even able to put his shield back up, no matter what – if you’re shield sliding really fast the game doesn’t let you do it instantly. However, this doesn’t happen every time. [gif 36 - overhead slash] You can also just do an overhead jab if you don’t have enough time to charge a slash: Keep in mind that in this variation, if the enemy manages to put his shield back up, you may get stunned due to jabbing his shield. Again, don’t be demotivated if this may seem a lot and is hard for you to learn. Many good knights struggled with this - it takes them a while before it clicks and shield bashes just feel natural to them. 2.6 Playing CTF At this point it’d be good if you’d visit the section for Playing CTF as well.

["knight-iii-advanced.html", "Chapter 3 Knight III: Advanced 3.1 Crouching 3.2 Some more moves and tricks 3.3 Using bombs (especially in 1v1s) 3.4 Combos after landing a successful slash 3.5 Noanims", " Chapter 3 Knight III: Advanced 3.1 Crouching This is another very important (and largely forgotten) feature in KAG. Basically, when you crouch (hold S) and not move in any direction, enemies do not collide with you. This allows you to do lots of new situational moves. Crouching also increases the radius of your shield. 3.1.1 Countering shieldbashes Aside from overhead attacks to counter enemies shield sliding into you, you can decide to crouch instead. The sliding enemy just goes through you and you can surprise them with an attack right after. You can actually crouch while doing any actions, as long as you don’t move. Also, you can’t see the enemies doing it - there isn’t a seperate animation for crouches 3.1.2 Countering stomps Crouches are a very good counter against stomps as well. If you see someone jumping at you from a distance (with their shield down) you should almost always crouch. [new gif ura 1] Keep in mind, however, that you can counter a crouching enemy by slashing them right before landing on them. If someone is charging a slash and wants to land on you, crouching probably isn’t a good idea. 3.1.3 Attacking while being ‘inside’ someone that’s shielding If the enemy crouches and you get inside them, you can also make use of that and attack them (with a jab or a slash). However, if they’re shielding, it requires you to slash or jab in a specific direction. You must attack in the direction they’re shielding, or instead the shield will protect them from the attack. [new gif 2 ura] If you’re fighting against a player who knows this technique, you can prevent them from damaging you by rapidly changing your direction of shielding. A common situation is you and your enemy both have your shields up and are running into each other (especially in narrow spaces). A good trick is to slightly move back and crouch, so that the enemy phases through you. As they get inside you, attack them. 3.2 Some more moves and tricks If you’re decent at doing the moves from the earlier chapter and they feel natural to you, you can learn these: 3.2.1 Countering double slashes If you’re in a situation when the enemy is constantly spamming slashes and you must shield yourself, they may eventually decide to charge a doubleslash. This can be countered: if you notice that they’re charging their slash for longer than usual, you can jab them and interrupt their slash. However… this can also be countered - the person charging a double slash can just release their button, counterjabbing the enemy. He can also just try to not be close enough for you to jab - in some situations if you’re fast enough and realise they’re going to double slash you can quickly run away with a quick shield slide, but if they’re fast they can just slash you before you do that. Also, if you know that the enemy knows how to interrupt double slashes with jabs, you can also prevent them from doing it. You can try charging a slash for a little longer than a perfect 15 tick (half a second) slash, but not as long as a double slash - if you’re lucky, the enemy will attempt a jab but you will slash them first and be able to damage them easily. 3.2.2 Counter jab A counter jab punishes the enemy for missing their attack. As the enemy ends their slash, turn around and quickly jab them. They won’t have time to shield. It’s a good way to play against players who just slashspam - bait them to jump at you with their slash, dodge it and then quickly jab right after. 3.2.3 Overhead jab A rather simple, mentioned already as a counter against when your enemy shieldslides, but you can do it when the enemy is just walking forward with their shield up as well: Jump over the enemy’s head quickly and jab them before they can react and move their shield. Don’t just click but instead hold your mouse button for a short while until you are at the perfect point to release the jab. 3.2.4 Tempo jab Often you will get into the situation where you are shielding and an enemy knight is repeatedly slashing you. Thus the other knight has the tempo advantage. If you try and slash them, then you will die as you will have begun charging your slash after them – so they will always be able to release earlier. One way to escape this situation is with a quick jab – which will interrupt the enemy’s slash. Beware though – if you have only 1 heart, a good enemy will instantly jab you back for the kill. Also, there’s a chance that the enemy will shield after slashing - worry not, you will learn what to do if this happens in the next chapter. 3.2.5 Fake jab Sometimes, when you and the enemy are shielding each other, you may attempt to do a fake jab to make the enemy think you jabbed their shield, then start shielding right after, like in the gif: [gif69] 3.2.6 Slash stomping (easy version) When you have height advantage over the enemy (at least 3 blocks), you can just jump down at them with a slash. The slash will pierce their shield and the momentum from slashing will let you stomp them for 1 heart of damage. Also, you can jab after every successful slashstomp: 3.2.7 Cancelling and baiting with a double slash This is somewhat related to the above and is a very fun trick to do. Basically, the idea is to charge a double slash, but only slash once, then shield. This way, you will get closer to the enemy, which will think you want to double slash them and try to counterjab, but will jab your shield instead. 3.2.8 Aggressive double slash This is a risky but potentially rewarding move. The aim is to take advantage of the large distance that a knight can travel whilst double slashing, hitting nothing with the first slash but hitting the enemy with the 2nd. For maximum effectiveness, do a small jump between the slashes so your movement forms a kind of ‘m’ shape – this will allow you to move as far as possible. 3.2.9 Chained shieldbashing It is possible to keep someone in a near permanent stunlock by repeatedly shield bashing them. This move is especially useful to counter someone who is holding a bomb, as they won’t be able to throw it while stunned. 3.3 Using bombs (especially in 1v1s) Being able to use bombs efficiently is an important part of 1v1s (in most duels and 1v1 tournaments, knights start with a single bomb). You can use them in several ways: 3.3.1 Using them to bomb jump If the enemy has a defensive playstyle, you may bomb jump and then slash stomp them. However, in some cases it’s possible for the enemy to counter it if they’re good enough, by slashing above at a correct angle with proper timing: 3.3.2 Using them after stunning someone Light a bomb and time its explosion with stunning an enemy, either by shield stunning them or slashing them. keep in mind that in the 2nd variation you also get damage because of not being able to shield the bomb (either 3 hearts if it explodes close to you, or 1.5 if a bit further). 3.3.3 Combat bomb Throw your bomb right so it explodes as it hits an enemy. Usually the best way to catch an enemy off guard is to aim it just behind their character or at their head. 3.3.4 Bomb and jab/slash combo The idea is to light a bomb and throw it behind the enemy (don’t do it too early – you don’t want them to throw it back), dealing 3 hearts of damage and stunning them for a short while, allowing you to do another jab and kill the enemy. If the enemy is far away, you can also do it with a slash (to have bigger range) [gif 23.2] 3.3.5 Water buoyancy for bombs Bombs in water will rise very quickly upwards. This can be used to surprise an enemy. 3.3.6 Catching and throwing back enemy bombs You can catch enemy bombs and throw them back! The best way to do this is to catch with C and throw with Space. This is because the Space key cannot catch, only throw – so it prevents you catching the bomb, throwing it, and catching it again – which might happen if you just spam C. Be careful doing this – if the enemy throws their bomb very late, you will just blow yourself up. Water bombs can also be caught, but you have to be careful, since water bombs will explode on impact. You must dodge the bomb, or catch it before it touches anything else. It’s best to do this when the bomb gets thrown above your head, as in the example below. 3.4 Combos after landing a successful slash If you’re good and fast enough, just by landing one successful slash (or just doing a doubleslash) you can finish the enemy in most of situations. 3.4.1 Slash + jab + shieldbash + jab Successful slash / double slash Jab Move away and then shield slide the enemy to break their shield Jab again 3.4.2 Slash + jab + overhead jab A successful slash / double slash + jab combined with an overhead jab. The enemy will still be ‘in shock’ from the slash + jab and usually won’t be fast enough to shield the final jab. 3.5 Noanims At this point, you may probably want to visit the noanims section. They’re a rather weird part of the game, but a part of it nonetheless and you should learn more about them. Visit the playing CTF section if you didn’t do so yet as well. "],
["knight-iv-expert.html", "Chapter 4 Knight IV: Expert 4.1 More advanced moves and tricks 4.2 Becoming the best", " Chapter 4 Knight IV: Expert 4.1 More advanced moves and tricks You’ll learn about the final tricks which you should learn now, requiring very good timing and being familiar with how the game works in general. 4.1.1 Aggressive jab (jab charge) An aggressive but extremely fun move; a jab charge is a quick shield slide to gain speed followed by a jab. This is an effective way to interrupt someone who is charging a slash – but for it to succeed it must be done with extreme speed and good timing. [gif 1] 4.1.2 Instajabs This is a very important move. It allows you to damage 99% of knights that slash your shield, even if they shield right after. Basically – there’s a small delay between slashing and putting your shield back up. If you put your shield up right after slashing, the animation may show, but the shield won’t actually be there. Moreover, it usually ends up causing messed up animations (if the enemy does an instajab) – because on your screen the enemy jabbed the shield. During that small delay, and right after your stun from being slashed in the shield is finished, you can jab the enemy. It requires good timing and quite a bit of training, honestly – which is why we have a bot (credit to Vamist) to train it, which you can download in the Miscellanous section. POV of instajabbing person: [gif 3] POV of instajabbed person: [gif 4] 4.1.3 Jab after being slashed+jabbed You can jab right after being slashed + jabbed: [gif 69] 4.1.4 Slash stomping (hard) Start charging a slash, jump from the highest point of the enemy (as mentioned earlier, the players’ model is an octagon) shielding up and try to land on a lower point, slightly to the side. This way the slash pierces their shield, and the additional velocity allows you to do a 1 heart stomp. [gif 5] 4.1.5 Shield bash + double jab Rather hard move to do, requires good timing and familarity with shield bashes. Basically, shieldbash someone and then very quickly double jab. [gif 6] 4.1.6 Shield bash + slash This one is more trivia than an actual trick – it’s very hard to do this consistently. Basically, you need to do the fastest slash possible right after stunning the enemy. You basically need to start charging the slash before you know the enemy is even stunned, which is why it’s so hard. [gif 7] 4.1.7 Blitz crouch This is a more advanced way to get ‘inside’ the enemy so you can attack him (credit to Auky for inventing and naming this). To do it, do a shield slide stun which will slightly pop the enemy up in the air. As they fall you move slightly under them and crouch so that they fall into you (both of your hitboxes are overlapping). Works the best when the enemy is next to a wall. At this point, you can phase through the enemy and attack them. [gif 8] 4.1.8 Glue after crouch When you and the enemy keep walking into each other, you can move back slightly, crouch and wait for him to get inside you, then release the crouch and start walking forawrd. In some cases you may glue yourself to the enemy – you should use this to your advantage and slash your enemy when he’s confused and doesn’t know what direction to shield. On your enemy’s screen, you aren’t inside him. Enemy’s POV: [gif55] Your POV: [gif56] 4.1.9 Shieldslide crouch Best works on flat terrain. Basically, do a quick shieldslide, but stop when you’re getting closer to the enemy. Start holding S. You will still have the momentum from the crouch and will get inside the enemy. If done with certain timing, it can glue the enemy with you as shown above. Hard to do consistently, so it’s again more trivia than an actually useful trick. [gif 9] 4.2 Becoming the best At this point, you know pretty much all the moves. If you can do all of them, all there’s left for you to do is just becoming perfect. Keep optimising your playstyle. Of course, you won’t ever stop doing mistakes completely, but now you just need to focus on doing them less and less. Train your timing and muscle memory to be even more perfect. We recommend getting into competitive CTF if you didn’t yet. In our opinion, competitive CTF (Captains, clanwars and so on) is much more fun than just plain 1v1s and playing TDMs. You also learn how to teamwork much better there, and in general it’s a lot more satisfying to play. If you want to learn even more about Knight, and want to win tournaments outside of your region, you could try learning and mastering playing with lags (for example, most EU players get 133-166 ping on US servers). For more about this, read the section about playing with lags. "],
["playing-ctf-1.html", "Chapter 5 Playing CTF 5.1 Dropping resupplies (‘dropping mats’) 5.2 Buying items 5.3 Teamwork 5.4 On the defense 5.5 On the offense 5.6 Random tricks", " Chapter 5 Playing CTF 5.1 Dropping resupplies (‘dropping mats’) Every time you respawn, you should change on your tent/ballista to builder and back to knight. This way you drop 100 wood and 30 stone (resupplies) and your builders will love you. It may not seem like a lot, but it really helps your builders. [gif 1] 5.2 Buying items There are a plethora of items to buy in CTF. The more people you kill, the more coins you gain. There’s no much point in hoarding all the coins – you lose some if you die. 5.2.1 Bombs Most knights decide to buy bombs (knight shop, 25 coins). They’re good for killing enemy builders and archers, especially when they try to escape from you. [gif 2] Using them to bomb jump to the enemy base also is a very good strategy. [gif 3] You can also use them in this way – if only one block thick wall (not doors) seperates you from the enemy, you can kill the enemy through the block: [gif 4] Good for killing builders ratting in your tower. 5.2.2 Burgers Burgers are also a decent item (quarters, also known as food shop, 20 coins). They heal you to full health. You can eat them quickly by pressing V. It’s useful when you’re fighting and don’t have much health – just eat a burger. Using them greatly improves your survivability. 5.2.3 Water bombs They stun the enemy (knight shop, 30 coins). Good for stunning enemies when you’re fighting several at once, or stunning archers/builders. Just stun anyone for easily kills. Countered if enemy has a sponge in inventory (as mentioned in the first chapter) [gif 5] [gif 6] 5.2.4 Sponges If you have one in inventory (builder shop, 15 coins), your stuns from water last much less. Good to buy if you know the enemy team has lots of archers spamming water. 5.2.5 Mines Mines are good (knight shop, 60 coins), especially when your team is on the defense. Place at least 1 in flagroom (if enemies get in there, they will be killed by the mine) [image] Place one in tunnels as well – ratting enemies in most cases don’t notice them and die. [image] Placing them next to enemy doors is good as well [image] 5.2.6 Kegs Very good explosive (knight shop, 120 coins). Good for destroying enemy structures. Don’t fight enemies while holding it – losing a keg is bad for your team. [gif 6 - dont do this] I recommend getting yourself launched from a catapult with a keg as well. [gif 7] Kegs, aside from exploding after 6 seconds, explode on impact if they’re lit and have enough velocity. [gif 8] 5.2.7 Ballista Good siege vehicle (siege shop, 200 coins), can be bought if you’ve got a lot of money. It lets people respawn on it, so I recommend putting it on top of your tower. [image] 5.2.8 Catapult Another good siege vehicle (siege shop, 200 coins) – lets you shoot people with it. Place on top of your tower. [image] 5.2.9 Arrows for your archers If you know that you have any good archers in team, you can buy them various arrows, such as fire arrows (especially if enemies got any big wooden structures), water arrows (for stunning enemies) or bomb arrows (for destroying enemy siege vehicles or structures). 5.3 Teamwork Aside from dropping mats, there’s some other stuff you should do. 5.3.1 Protect your builders Protect your builders that are trying to push the enemies and attack their base. It’s very important. Stay with them, kill enemies that try to touch them. [gif 9] However, if the builder is trying to rat into the enemy base and places doors, DON’T leave him and DON’T try to fight knights. You can often fail and open the doors for the enemies or just get yourself killed. Stay with the builder. [gif 10] 5.3.2 Catch bombs Builders and archers have no way to protect themselves from bombs. Catch enemy bombs and throw them back quickly to save them from certain death. [gif 11] 5.3.3 Pick up materials Pick up materials laying on the ground (in the order: gold &gt; stone &gt; wood) and deliver them to a safe spot or to the closest builder. Do this especially after killing enemy builders. [gif 12] 5.4 On the defense While you’re defending yourself from enemies pushing your tower, you should keep some stuff in mind. Some of these apply to other situations as well. 5.4.1 Focus on the builder Kill the builder at all costs. He’s the most dangerous – without him, it’s much harder for enemy knights to get inside your base. I recommend jumping from the top of the tower and just slashing him. [gif 13] 5.4.2 Mass-keg You can mass-keg the enemies if there are many of them. HOWEVER, drop the keg as late as possible – even if it means you will die. If you don’t do so, there’s a chance the enemies will catch it and use it against your tower. [gif 14] [gif 15] You can also just wait for it to get closer to explosion, and then drop it. Don’t need to fear about enemies using it against you this way. 5.4.3 Catch enemy kegs If you’re quick enough, you can catch enemy kegs by jumping and pressing C when the keg is about to hit the ground. [gif 16] Also applies to being on the offense - the enemy team may try to mass-keg you. 5.4.4 Slash ballista bomb bolts You can slash ballista bomb bolts with good timing. Greatly helps if you’re under heavy siege. [gif 17] 5.4.5 Shield enemy bomb arrows You should shield enemy bomb arrows, especially when they try to destroy your structures. [gif 18] 5.5 On the offense 5.5.1 Multi bomb jumps Aside from 1-bomb bomb jumps, you may sometimes want to use multi bomb jumps to get to the enemy base: 2 bombs: [gif 33] 3 bombs: [gif 34] 5.5.2 Enemy tunnels When you get to the enemy tunnel, constantly double slash it. This way, if any enemies go through it, you kill them easily (they’re stunned from tunnel travel). [gif 19] If you’re certain that they don’t have a sawtrap on their other tunnels, you can also try using them to get to their base. [gif 20] 5.5.3 Enemy siege vehicles Generally, if it’s a catapult, you should just destroy it, unless it still has wheels attached and you can use it to hurt the enemies. If you have enough time, capture it. As for ballistas, depends on the situation. Generally, if you’re safe on the enemy ballista, and no enemies are coming, capture it. If there are lots of enemies trying to get it back - destroy it, it gives you a lots of coins (just jabspam it) 5.6 Random tricks 5.6.1 Sawjump Bombs explode when they get destroyed. If bombs explode at the same moment, you can make a pretty awesome bombjump. Saws are used for this. Works like this: [gif 21] You can also do it with holding a keg in hand to get to the enemy base. [gif 22] Another variation includes holding a crate with a builder in it. 5.6.2 Keg + waterbomb This also applies to TDM. If you explode a water bomb on a keg (with enough momentum) the keg will quickly go forward, like this. [gif 23] Can be used to hurt enemy structures – enemies most likely won’t catch the keg. 5.6.3 Mine + bomb Mines need to stay still to be able to deploy – so you can’t deploy them in midair. However, you can deploy one on top of your enemy tower, and then push it forward with a bomb or a waterbomb. [gif 24] [gif 25] "],
["playing-with-lags.html", "Chapter 6 Playing with lags 6.1 Practice 6.2 Lag in KAG 6.3 How to play 6.4 Bomb jumping with lags", " Chapter 6 Playing with lags 6.1 Practice If you want to learn how to play lag, it’s basically like relearning KAG. 95% of being able to play with lag is just practice and training – there’s not much to be said in this chapter, however there are some things we’d like to say. But remember – want to rek on 166 ping, play A LOT on 166 ping. Focus on getting used to your positioning. Timing and whatnot is important of course, but getting used to where you really are is fundamental 6.2 Lag in KAG With lag, you do things earlier than they actually happen. This includes stuff like slashing, shielding and moving. Both your positioning and attacks are delayed. Unfortunately, this leads to frustration and bad animations. For example, on your screen you shield a jab, but you didn’t start shielding fast enough and it didn’t happen on the server. So the enemy now also has a noanim for you (Read: Dealing with noanims), and is in a fake stunned state. These are the little things that you just notice over time, small things that happen on ping only – as we said, just practice a lot and pay attention. 6.3 How to play Well, most of your playstyle on lags should consist of just slashes, preferably single slashes. They’re the easiest to learn on ping (their different range and timing) if you just use them a lot, and if you keep baiting enemies then you can even kill some rather good US players without dying much. Of course, you should still jab after slashes. We actually don’t know if most moves are possible with lags, but they are for sure MUCH, MUCH harder to do. For example, shieldbashing feels very odd with lag, at least when you’re on top of the enemy, so it is also a thing you should be careful with doing. Instajabs are still possible with lag (tested on 166 ping), however you really need to train it a lot to be able to use it consistently – avoid doing it in real matches until you train it. You could try setting up a server which you have 166 ping on and train the instajabs on there with the instajabbing bot (See: Miscellanous - Tick Table, other small tricks, training bots). 6.4 Bomb jumping with lags Well, this one is at least much easier with ping. You don’t need to be able to do double bomb jumps or triple bomb jumps. Just put 4 lit bombs on ground and you will even gain lots more velocity than normal. Actually pretty useful, especially with kegs. [gif] "],
["dealing-with-noanims.html", "Chapter 7 Dealing with noanims 7.1 What are noanims? 7.2 Play with sounds 7.3 Paying attention to the enemy’s headframe 7.4 Paying attention to the enemy’s mobility 7.5 Types of noanims", " Chapter 7 Dealing with noanims 7.1 What are noanims? Noanims are when animations desync between either you or your enemy’s client and the server – you see something else than what actually happened. Sometimes they are random, but sometimes they happen in specific situations as well. Lags, ping, and sometimes FPS may affect noanims. 7.2 Play with sounds You should always play with your sounds on. It’s MUCH easier to know what is happening even without noanims, and they are basically a must with noanims. Usually, when someone has a noanim, they start charging a slash – even with the noanim, you can hear them slashing. 7.3 Paying attention to the enemy’s headframe Heads have a seperate frame for when someone is charging an attack. This is how the difference looks on the default male Knight head: Normal frame: [img] Attack frame: [img 2] The most common situation is when the enemy’s animation is shielding, but they have the normal attack head frame. In this case, they’re actually slashing. Keep in mind, not every head has a different attack frame. 7.4 Paying attention to the enemy’s mobility You should also pay attention to the enemy’s mobility. If they slightly jumps around backwards and forwards with their shield up or a stunned animation, they’re also most likely slashing. 7.5 Types of noanims 7.5.1 Slash while shielding Random noanim, more likely to appear on those who are able to do quick slashes, may or may not be related to shielding right after slashing. As mentioned earlier, you can see the enemy’s head attack frame. [gif 1] 7.5.2 Slashes appearing as jabs Random noanim, appears when the enemy is able to do quick slashes. On your screen, they appear to not actually charge their attack enough for it to be a slash, so you see them jab you, but they actually charged a slash. Also happens sometimes with doubleslashes (appear as slash+jab or double jab). [gif 2] Since it appears as a jab for you, if you shielded the attack he will get the stunned animation. 7.5.3 Stun animation after jabbing shield Sometimes, the enemy may appear to jab your shield, and they get stunned on both your screen and the server, but not on their screen. They can still move around, but they can’t slash or shield, even if they can see animations for those actions on their own screen. Shielding person’s POV: [gif 3] Jabber’s POV: [gif 4] May cause further noanims (after trying to do such actions on their screen) If you think you jabbed the enemy’s shield (and these little yellow sparks appeared), and you’re still able to move, you should run away from the enemy as quickly as possible - you can’t shield now, after all. 7.5.4 Stun animation after jabbing shield version 2 In this case, on your screen they jabbed your shield, AND did 1 heart of damage to you. They got stunned on your screen only, and their slashes/shield still work. They didn’t jab your shield on the server or on their screen, hence the damage. [gif 5] 7.5.5 Shield animation after jabbing shield This is when the enemy jabs your shield and gets stunned, on both the server and their screen. He may appear to shield on your screen, but he’s actually stunned (you can see because he doesn’t move), so you can damage him. However, if you attempt to jab him, you damage him, but get stunned on your screen (but not on their screen) [gif 6] 7.5.6 Stun animation after enemy’s instajab After the enemy does an instajab (mentioned in Knight IV: Expert section), on your screen you may have been shielding him, but you actually weren’t. Magic. The enemy appears to be stunned for you then, but he’s actually not – he can still move around, slash and shield. [gif 7] "],
